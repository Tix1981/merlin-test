# Merlin React Code Test 2

## Getting Started:

To get started, run the following commands

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Tasks:

1. Using a library of your choice, implement functionality to allow dragging and dropping of tickets between columns.

2. When I click a ticket's title, a modal should appear containing it's title, description, acceptance criteria and estimate. Please do not use a component library to build the modal.

3. When I click the '+' button on a column, a modal should appear with a form, allowing me to create a new ticket.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
